# Population Genetics Reading Group

This page is for those participating in a reading group on population
genetics during the Spring semester of 2021. We meet Wednesdays at 10AM,
Mountain time. Most of the readings are Gillespie's
[Population genetics: a concise guide] [gillespie:concise].

*Prerequisite*: [Just enough probability.] [rogers:JEPr] You
should have this under your belt by the time we get to Gillespie's
chapter 2.

*Homework*: None is required, but it would not be a bad idea to do
 some. [Here] [homework] is a link to the homework problems that Jon
 Seger and I use in our course. Answers to even-numbered problems are
 in the back. In the syllabus below, I've listed the relevant homework
 chapters. 

*Computer exercises*: We're not doing those either, but in case you're
 interested, [here] [lab] is a link to the Python lab exercises that
 we use in our regular course.
